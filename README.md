## I am a .NET Developer!

After 15+ years as a construction painter I finally took the big step to quit my job to fulfill an old dream of becoming a programmer! I had no prior experience when I started this education. After my kids this is the best thing I have done with my life! The endorphine rush I get when coding is much higher than when I play video games!
